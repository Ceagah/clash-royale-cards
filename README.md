# Clash Royale Api Consumer

## How it works ?

This is a simple application to consume the [Royale api](https://royaleapi.github.io/), get all the CR cards, and display they descriptions.
This application is created to study how to make tests, pass props through the components, create a functional search input, and create a wonderful and responsive layout without copying anything.
